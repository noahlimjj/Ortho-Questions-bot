ID,Question,OptionA,OptionB,OptionC,OptionD,CorrectAnswer,Explanation
1,"What is the most common mechanism of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury?","Contact injury with valgus stress","Non-contact pivoting injury","Hyperextension injury","Direct blow to the knee","B","Most ACL injuries (70-80%) occur through non-contact mechanisms, typically during pivoting, cutting, or landing maneuvers when the knee is in slight flexion with valgus and external rotation forces."
2,"Which classification system is most commonly used for hip fractures?","Garden classification","AO classification","Lauge-Hansen classification","Salter-Harris classification","A","The Garden classification is the most widely used system for femoral neck fractures, categorizing them into 4 types based on displacement and angulation on AP radiographs."
3,"The 'unhappy triad' of the knee consists of tears to which three structures?","ACL, MCL, medial meniscus","ACL, PCL, LCL","PCL, MCL, lateral meniscus","ACL, LCL, lateral meniscus","A","The unhappy triad (O'Donoghue triad) consists of tears to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and medial meniscus, typically occurring with valgus and external rotation forces."
4,"What is the gold standard treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients?","Open reduction and internal fixation","Total hip arthroplasty","Hemiarthroplasty","Conservative management","B","Total hip arthroplasty is generally preferred for displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients due to lower reoperation rates and better functional outcomes compared to internal fixation."
5,"Which nerve is most commonly injured in humeral shaft fractures?","Median nerve","Ulnar nerve","Radial nerve","Axillary nerve","C","The radial nerve is most commonly injured in humeral shaft fractures due to its intimate relationship with the spiral groove (radial groove) on the posterior aspect of the mid-shaft humerus."
6,"The primary stabilizer of the shoulder against anterior dislocation is:","Rotator cuff","Labrum","Biceps tendon","Capsule","B","The labrum, particularly the anterior-inferior labrum and associated ligaments (Bankart lesion area), serves as the primary static stabilizer against anterior shoulder dislocation."
7,"Which bone is most commonly fractured in the wrist?","Radius","Ulna","Scaphoid","Lunate","C","The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone, typically occurring after a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH injury) with the wrist extended and radially deviated."
8,"The 'Ottawa Ankle Rules' are used to:","Determine surgical indication","Assess fracture stability","Guide radiographic imaging","Predict healing time","C","The Ottawa Ankle Rules are clinical decision rules used to determine when ankle radiographs are necessary, helping to reduce unnecessary X-rays while maintaining diagnostic accuracy."
9,"What is the most common complication of scaphoid fractures?","Infection","Nonunion","Nerve injury","Compartment syndrome","B","Nonunion is the most common complication of scaphoid fractures due to the bone's retrograde blood supply, particularly affecting the proximal pole which has limited vascular supply."
10,"The 'terrible triad' of the elbow includes:","Radial head fracture, coronoid fracture, posterior dislocation","Olecranon fracture, radial head fracture, coronoid fracture","Medial epicondyle fracture, lateral condyle fracture, posterior dislocation","Radial head fracture, ulnar fracture, anterior dislocation","A","The terrible triad consists of radial head fracture, coronoid process fracture, and posterior elbow dislocation, representing a complex injury pattern with high risk of instability and complications."
11,"Which imaging modality is best for diagnosing rotator cuff tears?","X-ray","CT scan","MRI","Ultrasound","C","MRI is the gold standard for diagnosing rotator cuff tears, providing excellent soft tissue contrast and ability to assess tear size, location, and quality of remaining tendon tissue."
12,"The 'drop arm test' is used to assess:","Biceps tendon rupture","Supraspinatus tear","Subscapularis tear","Infraspinatus tear","B","The drop arm test specifically evaluates supraspinatus function. A positive test (inability to slowly lower the arm from 90Â° abduction) suggests a significant supraspinatus tear."
13,"What is the primary indication for immediate surgery in ankle fractures?","Displaced fracture","Open fracture","Syndesmotic injury","Weber C fracture","B","Open fractures require immediate surgical intervention for irrigation, debridement, and stabilization to prevent infection and optimize healing outcomes."
14,"The 'Hawkins sign' in talus fractures indicates:","Avascular necrosis","Good blood supply","Malunion","Infection","B","A positive Hawkins sign (subchondral radiolucency seen 6-8 weeks post-injury) indicates maintained blood supply to the talar dome and suggests a lower risk of avascular necrosis."
15,"Which structure is most commonly injured in posterior shoulder dislocations?","Bankart lesion","Hill-Sachs lesion","Reverse Hill-Sachs lesion","SLAP tear","C","Posterior shoulder dislocations commonly cause a reverse Hill-Sachs lesion (anteromedial humeral head impaction fracture) due to impaction against the posterior glenoid rim."
