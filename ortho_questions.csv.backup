Empiric therapy should be started ASAP since open fractures are associated high rates of infection - usage of a broad spectrum antibiotic like cefazolin is common for grade I and II open fractures. However, since this is grade III, addition of gentamicin is indicated for gram negative cover. Prophylaxis and treatment for tetanus should be considered for every patient with an open fracture. Meticulous debridement of all devitalized tissue including bone tissue is crucial to prevent infection.,
17,. What factors would you not consider when deciding which muscle is devitalized during debridement?,Color,Consistency,Compressibility,Capacity to bleed,,C,Excise all devitalized tissue. Muscle provides an excellent environment for bacteria to flourish. Thus, extensive debridement of contaminated and devascularized tissue should be completed.

Intramedullary nail fixation (open reduction internal fixation) is gold standard for closed and unstable tibial shaft fractures and most exposed fractures (types I, II, and IIIA GustiloAnderson) because it gives good stabilization, allows early ROM and facilitates fracture consolidation while preventing malalignment. (Superior healing compared to external fixation) However, it requires additional tissue dissection which is contraindicated in severe open fractures (IIIB and C) because additional exposure can cause partial loss of periosteal, cortical or intramedullary blood supply, increasing risk of infection. Hence, external fixation (Pin-to-bar/ circular/ hybrid) is superior in this case since it reduces likelihood of further infection and provides easy access to the wound. (for further assessment and debridement in the future) Lastly, the wound is usually left opened for 48 hours before closing up due to the dangers of tension & infection present in the first 2 days. This is mostly due to the worry of gas gangrene being formed by clostridial infections when there is extensive soft tissue damage and to ensure that there is viable soft tissue before closing up. However, recently new research papers suggest early wound closure could be a superior option  especially for grade IIIA and below and those which have been adequately debrided.

72,"A 50-year-old man, with a PMHx of long standing diabetes, comes to the sports medicine office because he has pain in his right hip and thigh that has been worsening since he fell while working in his yard two weeks ago. He is also noted to febrile with a temperature of 38.3C. Erythema and warmth are noted over the lateral aspect of the right hip and the proximal aspect of the right thigh. Full range of motion of the hip is noted, and distal sensation and pulses are intact. On laboratory studies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 29 mm/hr (normal: 0-15 m/hr). Results of full blood cell count are within normal limits. X-ray studies of the hip show a slightly raised periosteum in the proximal femoral shaft. Which of the following additional diagnostic studies is most appropriate?",CT scan,Indium 111 bone scan,MRI,Technetium 99m bone scan,Ultrasonography,C,"The clinical presentation is characteristic of osteomyelitis, and MRI is the most appropriate study to confirm this diagnosis because it shows loss or blurring of normal fat planes, periostitis, marrow edema and periosteal elevation. A is incorrect because this study is not sensitive for acute osteomyelitis. Option B, indium 111 bone scan, and Option D, technetium 99m bone scan, are incorrect because although these studies might show increased metabolic activity in patients with osteomyelitis, this finding is not distinguishable from post-traumatic injury, cancer, or postoperative findings. Option E, ultrasonography, is incorrect because this study can only show fluid collection next to bone, which is not distinguishable from a traumatic response.",
73,"An 8 year old girl, Eva, presents with her mother after falling from a trampoline yesterday. She has been unable to walk on her left leg since the accident and is complaining that her ankle is sore. She is otherwise fit and well with no significant PMH. She is on no regular medication, has no known drug allergies. On examination she has a swollen and tender medial malleolus with a markedly reduced ROM. She screams when you touch the medial aspect of her ankle. The foot is neurovascularly intact. No wounds are evident. X-rays which were taken are shown below. What does this X-ray show?",Salter- harris type I,Salter- harris type II,Salter- harris type III,Salter- harris type IV,Salter- harris type V,B,,
74,A 16-year-old male patient presented to the ED following a varus injury to his right knee which was sustained during a football game. It was noted that he was unable to bear weight. There was a gross effusion of the knee which he held at 5 of flexion and examination showed tenderness over the lateral aspect of the distal femur. He also complained that he was having difficulties dorsiflexing his foot. What other features could he present with?,Difficulties inverting his foot,Tingling sensation on the dorsum of his foot,Numbness at the posteromedial side of the lower leg,Inability to plantarflex his big toe,There is posterior sag of the knee,B,"The case vignette seems to suggest that the patient could be suffering from a LCL tear which is complicated by common peroneal nerve palsy. This is because there is a varus injury and common peroneal nerve palsy is usually associated with foot drop, inability in dorsiflexion and eversion, sensory disturbance of anterolateral side of the lower leg and dorsum of foot.",
75,A 20 year old patient presents to the ED unconscious following a car accident. What would be your next appropriate management?,AP view X- ray,Odontoid view x-ray,Apply C-spine collar,Intubation,Try moving the neck to test ROM of neck,C,"Always suspect C-spine injuries in patients who present after fall from height, diving accident or vehicle accident in which neck is forcibly moved. Furthermore, look out for the following signs and symptoms of cervical spine fracture / spinal cord injury (Unconscious from head injury, abnormal position of neck, tenderness on palpation or pain/ parasthesia in limbs). Secure C-spine before ABCs to prevent any unwanted trauma. In such high risk patients, only remove C-collar after confirming through imaging.",
76,"67-year-old man develops sudden severe right arm pain and paresthesia with brachial artery occlusion, thrombocytopenia (60,000/mm³), and prolonged aPTT six days after femur fracture fixation surgery. What is the most likely explanation?",Peripheral arterial disease,Patent foramen ovale,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,Adverse effect of medication,Fat embolization,D,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is an immune-mediated adverse effect of heparin occurring 5–14 days after initiation, characterized by thrombocytopenia and paradoxical thrombotic events such as arterial occlusion despite elevated aPTT.",

78,"An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman with hypertension and a history of gastroesophageal reflux–related esophageal stricture is found on routine screening to have a T-score of –2.6 SD. She experienced menarche at age 11, menopause 8 years ago, and was treated for endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago; her last mammogram and Pap smear 6 months ago were normal. She has no children, a maternal history of breast cancer, and currently takes lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. The physician recommends raloxifene for osteoporosis prophylaxis and asks about its specific adverse effects.",Mandibular osteonecrosis,Endometrial cancer,Osteosarcoma,Hypercholesterolemia,Deep venous thrombosis,E,"Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as an estrogen agonist in bone and antagonist in breast and endometrium, reducing bone resorption without increasing endometrial cancer risk. However, it mimics estrogen's prothrombotic effects, significantly increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism such as deep venous thrombosis. It does not cause mandibular osteonecrosis or osteosarcoma, and it does not adversely affect lipid profiles to cause hypercholesterolemia. Patient counseling should emphasize VTE risk when starting raloxifene.",
