22,"A 47 year old woman, who had just finished her surgical fixation for a complex distal radial fracture of the right arm 12 hours ago, complains of severe forearm pain in the PACU. The anesthetist suspects that the increasing pain is caused by an incomplete nerve block and hence she performs another nerve block with ropivacaine.

Being Dr. Ooguway, the Master of Medicine, what would be the least appropriate next step in this case?","Check if there is any tingling or pin prick sensation over the area","Check for pale skin tone over the area","Use a needle manometer","Passively extend the muscles and see whether there is increase in pain","Check for any weakness in movement of fingers","C","This is commonly used for unconscious/obtunded patients in clinical practice because you can't elicit pain history from them.

Empiric therapy should be started ASAP since open fractures are associated high rates of infection - usage of a broad spectrum antibiotic like cefazolin is common for grade I and II open fractures. However, since this is grade III, addition of gentamicin is indicated for gram negative cover. Prophylaxis and treatment for tetanus should be considered for every patient with an open fracture. Meticulous debridement of all devitalized tissue including bone tissue is crucial to prevent infection.","https://example.com/open_fracture_management.jpg"
