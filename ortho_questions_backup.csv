57,How would you manage this fracture?,Immediate wound closure and casting,External fixation and then close the wound after 48 hours,Intramedullary nail fixation and then close the wound within 24 hours,Intramedullary nail fixation and then close the wound after 48 hours,External fixation and then close the window within 24 hours,B,"Casting is only used for very stable grade 1 and 2 open fractures which have minimal soft tissue damage. Intramedullary nail fixation (open reduction internal fixation) is gold standard for closed and unstable tibial shaft fractures and most exposed fractures (types I, II, and IIIA GustiloAnderson) because it gives good stabilization, allows early ROM and facilitates fracture consolidation while preventing malalignment. (Superior healing compared to external fixation) However, it requires additional tissue dissection which is contraindicated in severe open fractures (IIIB and C) because additional exposure can cause partial loss of periosteal, cortical or intramedullary blood supply, increasing risk of infection. Hence, external fixation (Pin-to-bar/ circular/ hybrid) is superior in this case since it reduces likelihood of further infection and provides easy access to the wound. (for further assessment and debridement in the future) Lastly, the wound is usually left opened for 48 hours before closing up due to the dangers of tension & infection present in the first 2 days. This is mostly due to the worry of gas gangrene being formed by clostridial infections when there is extensive soft tissue damage and to ensure that there is viable soft tissue before closing up. However, recently new research papers suggest early wound closure could be a superior option  especially for grade IIIA and below and those which have been adequately debrided.

Ch2_Q3,When performing flexor tendon repair which of the following pulleys must be preserved?,A2 and A4,A2 only,A2 and C2,A2 and A3,A3 only,A,Any exposure of the flexor tendons in their sheath and pulley system runs the risk of disrupting a magnificent engineering wonder. The pulleys serve a very important function in creating strong lever arms for the tendons. The most important of these are the A2 and A4 pulleys. Transection results in bow-stringing with subsequent weakness of flexion.,,Hand and Wrist
Ch2_Q4,A Stener lesion is significant because?,Adductor aponeurosis interposition between the proximally based avulsed ligament impairs ligament healing,Adductor aponeurosis interposition between the distally based avulsed ligament impairs ligament healing,Skiing is an increasingly popular sport,It involves partial and complete ulnar collateral ligament rupture,It is associated with a fleck sign on the X-ray,B,In 1962 Stener described the lesion. It only occurs in complete rupture and it is thus important to clinically differentiate complete and incomplete ruptures. If the aponeurosis is interposed then complete healing of the distal fragment will not take place and despite the period of immobilization there will be excess ulnar laxity.,,Hand and Wrist
Ch2_Q5,Which of the following regarding metacarpal neck fractures is true?,Up to 35° of angulation of the index and middle finger can be accepted,Up to 40° of angulation of the little and ring finger can be accepted,Metacarpal neck fractures should never be operated upon unless it is an open injury,The Jahss position is the correct position to immobilize a manipulated metacarpal neck fracture,Up to 15° of angulation of the index and middle finger can be accepted,E,Most hand surgeons would agree that there is between 15 and 30° of mobility at the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint of the ring and little fingers. This allows the surgeon to accept large amounts of deformity at the distal metacarpal neck fracture. There is consensus on the index and to a lesser degree middle finger. They do not have much compensation so 10-15° is the maximum allowed deformity.,,Hand and Wrist
Ch2_Q6,When reducing a Smith's or volar Barton's fracture the reduction manoeuvre should include?,Supination only,Extension only,Extension and supination,Extension and pronation,Flexion and supination,C,This question tests the understanding of the deforming forces of a fracture.

Ch2_Q16,A 56-year-old obese man presents with a painless deterioration in bilateral hand function. Initially it was the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints that were involved and now it is the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. He has thick tight skin and a positive prayer sign. The most likely disease is?,Gout,Osteoarthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Scleroderma,Diabetic cheirarthropathy,E,This is a poorly understood condition. It is thought to be as a result of a muscular or tendon imbalance with soft tissue disruption. It is more common in Type 1 diabetics and can affect 8-50% of the population. Loss of function is painless and progresses from distal to proximal. The prayer sign is an inability to oppose palmar surfaces.,,Hand and Wrist
Ch2_Q17,A 38-year-old man presents with dorsal wrist pain. He has a stiff wrist with very limited range of motion and can't work as a mechanic. Plain films reveal Grade IV Kienbock's disease. He should be treated with?,Proximal row carpectomy,Wrist replacement,Curettage and vascularized pronator quadratus graft,Radial shortening,Wrist arthrodesis,E,The Lichtman classification system essentially divides Kienbock's disease into types that can be treated with therapeutic operations such as radial shortening or grafting versus those that need salvage operations such as partial or complete wrist arthrodesis. Stage 4 with generalized degenerative changes in the carpus requires wrist arthrodesis.,,Hand and Wrist
Ch2_Q18,A 41-year-old woman sustained a distal radius fracture whilst hiking in the Andes. It was treated in plaster by a local missionary doctor and went on to malunion. She presents with ulnar-sided pain and on examination she impacts on the ulnar side with a negative grind test at the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). The best treatment would be?,Ulnar shortening osteotomy,Darrach procedure,Sauve-Kapandji procedure,Arthroscopic debridement of DRUJ,Distal ulnar head implant arthroplasty,A,It is uncommon for younger people to present with significant radial shortening as their fractures are usually well managed. In this case there is ulna impaction syndrome. The aim is to reduce this impaction. There is no need to address the DRUJ or replace the distal ulna.,,Hand and Wrist
Ch2_Q19,Which of the following is not true of Dupuytren's disease?,The long-term recurrence rate is 50%,Painful nodules are an indication for surgery,Metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) contracture of greater than 30° is an indication for surgery,Myofibroblasts are the offending cells in the aetiology of the disease,Concomitant carpal tunnel release increases incidence of post-operative flare,B,The disease is usually in its early phases. The stages according to Luck's classification are proliferative involutional and finally residual. Early surgery will certainly lead to recurrence and can stimulate the disease process. Carpal tunnel surgery must be performed at a separate occasion for a similar reason. Unfortunately in the long term recurrence rates are high (50%).,,Hand and Wrist
Ch2_Q20,A 17-year-old snowboarder fell onto his outstretched pronated hand. He presents with ongoing ulnar-sided wrist pain. He is tender over the ulnar fovea and has no click. The distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is stable. Plain films are normal and a MR arthrogram show a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) defect adjacent to the ulna. How is this classified according to the Palmer classification?,Class 2A lesion,Class 1A lesion,Class 2B lesion,Class 1B lesion,Class 1C lesion,D,TFCC tears are divided into acute (1) and chronic (2) by the Palmer classification. Class 1B is ulnar avulsion with or without ulnar styloid fracture. The majority of isolated TFCC injuries do not require early surgical management.,,Hand and Wrist
Ch2_Q21,A 16-year-old girl had multiple fractures in her forearm and hand. One year later after fracture healing she presents with trouble gripping things. When the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint is extended you cannot passively flex the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. When the MCP joint is flexed it is possible to passively flex the PIP joint. Her extensors are at a good length. Which of the following is incorrect?,She has an intrinsic plus hand,She has a claw hand,She has a positive Bunnell test,She has a likely positive Bouviere effect,There is an imbalance between the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles,B,She has tight intrinsic muscles and her Bunnell test is positive as the intrinsic muscles are more powerful than her extrinsic extensors and flexors. An intrinsic minus hand is one where there is a loss of function in the ulna and sometimes the median nerve (claw).,,Hand and Wrist
Ch2_Q22,A 23-year-old cricketer had an avulsion of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon of his ring finger. This was diagnosed early and despite proximal migration he had it reinserted with a button technique. Six months later he complains that he cant close his fingers tightly over a cricket ball. This problem is?,Lumbrical plus effect,Swan neck deformity,Quadrigia effect,Intrinsic tightness,Chronic mallet finger,C,Though this was a bony avulsion it must be thought of like any other FDP tendon injury. Because of the proximal migration of the tendon it was probably repaired tightly with an adhesed improperly tensioned FDP. Because the adjacent remaining fingers share a common muscle belly they cannot flex entirely (quadrigia effect).,,Hand and Wrist
Ch2_Q23,Which of the following is true regarding a Mayfield Stage I injury?,There is not always a scaphoid fracture,There is a lunotriquetral ligament injury,The lunate is extruded,There is a radio-scapho-capitate ligament detachment,There is a perilunate dislocation,A,To understand carpal instability it is essential to appreciate the ligamentous attachments.
