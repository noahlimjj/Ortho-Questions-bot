Examination reveals tenderness over the ulnar styloid and a positive ECU synergy test with ballooning of a tendon on the dorsal ulnar wrist when attempting to spread fingers against resistance. What is the MOST likely diagnosis?","De Quervain tenosynovitis","Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinitis","Triangular fibrocartilage complex tear","Distal radioulnar joint arthritis","Ulnar styloid fracture nonunion","B","The clinical presentation with positive ECU synergy test (ballooning of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon when spreading fingers against resistance) is pathognomonic for ECU tendinitis. The ECU synergy test specifically assesses the ECU tendon by having the patient spread their thumb, index, and middle fingers apart while the examiner attempts to squeeze them together. A positive test shows visible ballooning or subluxation of the ECU tendon on the dorsal ulnar aspect of the wrist. De Quervain tenosynovitis affects the first dorsal compartment (APL and EPB) on the radial side and is tested with Finkelstein's test. TFCC tears cause ulnar-sided pain but would have a positive fovea sign and piano key test rather than ECU synergy test.

"146","A 28-year-old woman falls on her outstretched hand and presents with wrist pain. X-rays show a scaphoid waist fracture with 2mm displacement. What is the MOST appropriate initial management?","Short arm cast for 6 weeks","Long arm thumb spica cast for 6 weeks then short arm cast","Open reduction and internal fixation with headless compression screw","MRI to assess vascularity before deciding treatment","Percutaneous screw fixation","C","Displaced scaphoid fractures (>1mm displacement) require operative management with open reduction and internal fixation using a headless compression screw. The 2mm displacement in this case is an absolute indication for surgery because non-operative management of displaced fractures leads to high rates of nonunion, AVN, and post-traumatic arthritis. Non-displaced scaphoid fractures (<1mm) can be managed conservatively with casting, but displaced fractures will not heal reliably without anatomic reduction and stable fixation. While scaphoid blood supply enters distally, MRI is not necessary prior to acute fixation of a displaced fracture. Percutaneous fixation alone without open reduction cannot achieve anatomic reduction of a displaced fracture. The proximal pole receives its blood supply retrograde from the distal scaphoid, making displaced waist fractures at high risk for AVN and nonunion if not properly reduced and stabilized.",""
"147","A 55-year-old diabetic woman complains of progressive numbness in her thumb, index, and middle fingers that wakes her at night. Tinel's test at the wrist is positive and Phalen's test reproduces symptoms after 30 seconds. Nerve conduction studies show prolonged distal motor latency of 4.8ms (normal <4.0ms) and sensory latency of 3.9ms (normal <3.5ms). What is the MOST appropriate next step in management?","Immediate carpal tunnel release surgery","Nighttime wrist splinting and NSAIDs for 6 weeks","Corticosteroid injection into carpal tunnel","EMG to assess for cervical radiculopathy","Vitamin B12 supplementation","B","This patient has mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome based on clinical findings and nerve conduction studies showing mild prolongation of latencies. Conservative management is appropriate as first-line treatment for mild-moderate CTS, including nighttime wrist splinting in neutral position and NSAIDs for 6-8 weeks. Studies show that 80% of mild-moderate CTS cases improve with conservative treatment. Surgery is indicated for severe CTS (thenar atrophy, constant numbness, motor latency >6ms), failed conservative treatment after 6-12 weeks, or patient preference. Corticosteroid injection can be used but is typically reserved for patients who fail splinting or as a diagnostic test. The positive Tinel's and Phalen's tests with classic distribution and positive NCS confirm the diagnosis of CTS, making cervical radiculopathy unlikely. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes peripheral neuropathy with glove-stocking distribution, not isolated median nerve symptoms.",""
"148","A 32-year-old mechanic sustains a crush injury to his hand. Four hours later, he develops severe pain in the hand despite adequate analgesia. On examination, the intrinsic muscles are tense, passive finger extension causes severe pain, and two-point discrimination is decreased. Compartment pressure measures 38mmHg. What is the MOST appropriate management?","Elevation and ice with repeat examination in 2 hours","Immediate fasciotomy of all hand compartments","Mannitol infusion and hyperbaric oxygen therapy","Observation with hourly neurovascular checks","Fasciotomy only if pressure exceeds 40mmHg","B","This patient has acute compartment syndrome of the hand, which is an orthopedic emergency requiring immediate fasciotomy. The classic signs are present: severe pain disproportionate to injury, pain with passive stretch, tense compartments, and sensory deficits. A compartment pressure of 38mmHg with clinical signs of compartment syndrome is an absolute indication for emergency fasciotomy. The hand has 10 compartments: 4 dorsal interossei, 3 palmar interossei, thenar, hypothenar, and adductor pollicis. Waiting for arbitrary pressure thresholds (like 40mmHg) or delta pressure calculations can lead to irreversible muscle necrosis and Volkmann's contracture. The diagnosis of compartment syndrome is primarily clinical, and pressures are adjunctive. Elevation may worsen perfusion by decreasing arteriovenous gradient. Fasciotomy must be performed within 6-8 hours of symptom onset to prevent permanent damage. All compartments should be released, typically through dorsal and palmar incisions. Mannitol and hyperbaric oxygen have no proven benefit and delay definitive treatment.",""
"149","A 6-year-old boy presents after jamming his finger in a door. X-ray shows a Salter-Harris type II fracture of the proximal phalanx with 35-degree apex volar angulation. What is the MOST appropriate management?","Closed reduction and buddy taping","Closed reduction and percutaneous K-wire fixation","Open reduction and plate fixation","Splinting without reduction due to remodeling potential","Observation only as this is a non-displaced fracture","B","Proximal phalanx fractures in children with >20 degrees of angulation require reduction and stabilization. Although pediatric bones have excellent remodeling potential, the proximal phalanx has limited remodeling capacity for angular deformities, and 35 degrees of apex volar angulation will result in functional impairment and cosmetic deformity. Salter-Harris type II fractures are inherently unstable due to the metaphyseal fragment. Closed reduction with percutaneous K-wire fixation is the gold standard for displaced pediatric phalangeal fractures, providing stable fixation while minimizing soft tissue disruption. Simple buddy taping after reduction would not provide adequate stability for this degree of displacement. Open reduction with plate fixation is unnecessarily invasive for this fracture pattern. Observation is inappropriate given the significant angulation. The acceptable angulation for proximal phalanx fractures is <10 degrees in the coronal plane and <20 degrees in the sagittal plane. Remodeling potential exists primarily in the plane of joint motion and in younger children, but cannot be relied upon for this degree of deformity.",""
"150","A 45-year-old woman presents with numbness in her ring and small fingers. Examination reveals weakness of finger abduction, positive Froment's sign, and a positive Wartenberg's sign. Tinel's test is positive at Guyon's canal. What is the MOST likely site of nerve compression?","Carpal tunnel","Cubital tunnel at the elbow","Guyon's canal (Zone II)","Arcade of Struthers","Pronator syndrome at the forearm","C","This patient has ulnar nerve compression at Guyon's canal (Zone II), which affects the deep motor branch while sparing sensation to the dorsum of the hand (dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve branches proximal to Guyon's canal). Froment's sign (thumb IP flexion when attempting key pinch due to adductor pollicis weakness with FPL compensation) and Wartenberg's sign (abducted small finger due to unopposed EDM with weak palmar interosseous) indicate ulnar nerve motor dysfunction. Positive Tinel's at Guyon's canal localizes the compression. Guyon's canal has three zones: Zone I affects both motor and sensory, Zone II affects only deep motor branch (as in this case), and Zone III affects only superficial sensory branch. Cubital tunnel syndrome would include dorsal hand sensory loss and often causes medial elbow symptoms. Carpal tunnel affects median nerve distribution (thumb, index, middle fingers). Arcade of Struthers and pronator syndrome are not ulnar nerve compression sites. The preservation of sensation to the dorsal hand in this case specifically indicates compression distal to the branching of the dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve.",""
"152","A 19-year-old basketball player sustains a hyperextension injury to his index finger. He is unable to actively flex the DIP joint, but passive motion is full. The finger is held in slight hyperextension at the DIP. X-rays are normal. What structure is MOST likely injured?","Flexor digitorum superficialis","Flexor digitorum profundus","Central slip of extensor mechanism","Volar plate","Terminal extensor tendon","B","Inability to actively flex the DIP joint indicates rupture of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon, which is the only structure that flexes the DIP joint. This typically occurs with forceful hyperextension while the finger is actively flexing (jersey finger). The FDP test is performed by stabilizing the proximal and middle phalanges in extension and asking the patient to flex the DIP joint. The ring finger FDP is most commonly affected, but any finger can be involved. FDS flexes only the PIP joint and would not affect DIP motion. Central slip injury causes boutonniere deformity with PIP flexion and DIP hyperextension, opposite to this presentation. Volar plate injuries cause PIP hyperextension instability but preserve active DIP flexion. Terminal extensor tendon injury (mallet finger) causes inability to extend, not flex, the DIP joint. Leddy and Packer classification: Type I (tendon retracts to palm, disrupts vincula, urgent surgery needed), Type II (tendon retracts to PIP, most common, surgery within 7-10 days), Type III (bony avulsion fragment prevents retraction, surgery within 6-8 weeks).

"153","A 42-year-old office worker presents with pain at the base of her thumb, worse with gripping and pinching. Examination reveals tenderness over the radial styloid and a positive Finkelstein's test. Conservative management fails after 8 weeks. What is the MOST appropriate next step?","Corticosteroid injection into the first dorsal compartment","Thumb spica splinting for additional 6 weeks","Surgical release of the first dorsal compartment","MRI of the wrist to rule out scaphoid pathology","Corticosteroid injection into the CMC joint","A","After failed conservative management of De Quervain tenosynovitis, corticosteroid injection into the first dorsal compartment is the appropriate next step before considering surgery. Studies show that steroid injection provides relief in 60-90% of cases who fail splinting. The injection should be given into the first dorsal compartment containing the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendons, taking care to inject around (not into) the tendons and to identify and treat any separate EPB subcompartment. Finkelstein's test (thumb tucked in palm, ulnar deviation causes pain) confirms the diagnosis. If injection fails or symptoms recur, surgical release is indicated with careful identification and release of all APL and EPB subcompartments while protecting the superficial radial nerve branches. Extended splinting beyond 6-8 weeks without additional intervention is unlikely to provide benefit. MRI is not necessary with classic presentation and positive Finkelstein's test. CMC joint injection would not address first dorsal compartment tenosynovitis, though CMC arthritis can coexist and should be evaluated separately with grind test.",""
"154","A 50-year-old man sustains a high-pressure paint gun injection injury to his index finger. He presents 3 hours after injury with minimal external signs of trauma but complains of severe pain and swelling. What is the MOST appropriate immediate management?","Observation with hand elevation and antibiotics","Immediate surgical debridement and decompression","X-ray to identify foreign material then outpatient follow-up","Soaking in warm water and oral antibiotics","Incision and drainage in the emergency department","B","High-pressure injection injuries are devastating injuries requiring immediate surgical debridement and decompression. Despite minimal external appearance (small puncture wound), these injuries cause extensive tissue damage from the injected material (paint, grease, oil) spreading along fascial planes, causing chemical inflammation, ischemia, and necrosis. Paint and organic solvents are particularly toxic. The low threshold for tissue injury combined with the closed-space nature of digital anatomy creates a surgical emergency. Delay in treatment (>6 hours) significantly increases amputation rates (up to 60% vs 10% if treated early). Emergency surgical management includes wide debridement of all affected tissue, compartment release, thorough irrigation, and leaving wounds open. Multiple staged debridements are often necessary. Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics should be given, but surgery cannot be delayed. Simple drainage is inadequate as the injected material spreads diffusely. X-rays should not delay surgery but may help identify extent of material spread. The Ryzewicz-Stern classification helps predict outcomes based on material type (organic solvents worse than water-based), pressure, and anatomic location.",""
