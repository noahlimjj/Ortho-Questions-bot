Which of the following additional diagnostic studies is most appropriate?",CT scan,Indium 111 bone scan,MRI,Technetium 99m bone scan,Ultrasonography,C,"The clinical presentation is characteristic of osteomyelitis, and MRI is the most appropriate study to confirm this diagnosis because it shows loss or blurring of normal fat planes, periostitis, marrow edema and periosteal elevation. A is incorrect because this study is not sensitive for acute osteomyelitis. Option B, indium 111 bone scan, and Option D, technetium 99m bone scan, are incorrect because although these studies might show increased metabolic activity in patients with osteomyelitis, this finding is not distinguishable from post-traumatic injury, cancer, or postoperative findings. Option E, ultrasonography, is incorrect because this study can only show fluid collection next to bone, which is not distinguishable from a traumatic response.",

Sensory distribution of the radial nerve includes the first dorsal web space of the hand, and motor innervation includes the dorsal forearm extensor muscles, including those of the wrist. B is incorrect since it refers to median nerve injury ? not a common nerve to be injured in this context. This nerve courses through the medial aspect of the arm between the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles. C is incorrect since it refers to ulnar nerve injury ? not a common nerve to be injured in this context.

Tinel's sign at the wrist is classic for median nerve irritation. Ulnar nerve compression affects the medial hand, while radial nerve lesions do not cause thenar wasting.",""
"79","A 22-year-old man sustains a fall onto his outstretched hand. He has tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox and pain with axial loading of the thumb.

Initial X-rays may be negative, so immobilization in a thumb spica cast and repeat imaging in 10-14 days is recommended. Early fixation is reserved for displaced fractures. Physiotherapy and observation are inappropriate without excluding fracture.",""
