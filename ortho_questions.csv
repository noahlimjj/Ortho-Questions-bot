17,. What factors would you not consider when deciding which muscle is devitalized during debridement?,Color,Consistency,Compressibility,Capacity to bleed,"",C,Excise all devitalized tissue. Muscle provides an excellent environment for bacteria to flourish. Thus, extensive debridement of contaminated and devascularized tissue should be completed. Attention to the classic "C"s of muscle viability can assist the decision for excision: color, consistency, contractility, and capacity to bleed. Caution should be taken with excision of tendons and ligaments.,
18,. How would you manage this fracture?,Immediate wound closure and casting,External fixation and then close the wound after 48 hours,Intramedullary nail fixation and then close the wound within 24 hours,Intramedullary nail fixation and then close the wound after 48 hours,"",B,Casting is only used for very stable grade 1 and 2 open fractures which have minimal soft tissue damage.,
19,. The external fixation was done and the surgery went well. The pateints trachea was extubated and he was then transported to the Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU). However, during the first hour, his oxygen saturation dropped to 85-90% and hence he is delivered oxygen at 2 litres/min via nasal cannula.

On closer inspection, petechial rash was seen over the patients chest and he had subconjunctival hemorrhage too.,Pulmonary embolism,Sepsis,Fat embolism,Pneumonia,"",C,Fat embolism syndrome (FES) typically manifests 24 to 72 hours after the initial insult, but may rarely occur as early as 12 hours or as late as two weeks after the inciting event. Affected patients develop a classic triad: hypoxemia (most common symptom and may mimic ARDS), neurologic abnormalities (range from the development of an acute confusional state and altered level of consciousness to seizures and focal deficits) , and a petechial rash (most often on the nondependent regions of the body including the head, neck, anterior thorax, axillae, and sub-conjunctiva).,
20,. A 47 year old woman, who had just finished her surgical fixation for a complex distal radial fracture of the right arm 12 hours ago, complains of severe forearm pain in the PACU. The anesthetist suspects that the increasing pain is caused by an incomplete nerve block and hence she performs another nerve block with ropivacaine. However, the patient was still screaming due to severe pain and hence the anesthetist came to you. Being Dr. Ooguway, the Master of Medicine, what would be the least appropriate next step in this case?,Check if there is any tingling or pin prick sensation over the area,Check for pale skin tone over the area,Use a needle manometer,Passively extend the muscles and see whether there is increase in pain,"",C,This is commonly used for unconscious/obtunded patients in clinical practice because you can�t elicit pain history from them. However, if the patient complains of excruciating pain and if in the right clinical context, emergency management for compartment syndrome can be performed. Check for 5 �P�s if suspect compartment syndrome � Pain, Paresthesia, pressure, pallor, pulselessness.,

41,"A 72-year-old woman falls from standing height and presents with left hip pain and inability to bear weight. AP pelvis shows a displaced femoral neck fracture with loss of femoral head-neck continuity. She walks independently prior to the fall. What is the most appropriate definitive management?","Dynamic hip screw fixation","Cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty","Uncemented total hip arthroplasty","Cemented total hip arthroplasty","Percutaneous cannulated screw fixation",D,"Displaced femoral neck fracture in an active, independent elderly patient is best treated with arthroplasty to reduce reoperation risk compared to fixation. Cemented stems reduce periprosthetic fracture and improve early function in the elderly. Total hip arthroplasty is preferred over hemiarthroplasty in higher-demand community ambulators. Cemented THA is therefore most appropriate. DHS and cannulated screws have high nonunion/AVN rates in displaced fractures. Uncemented THA has higher intraoperative fracture risk in osteoporotic bone.",
42,"A 28-year-old motorcyclist sustains an open midshaft tibial fracture with periosteal stripping and 10 cm wound contamination with soil. After resuscitation, what is the correct Gustilo-Anderson classification?","Type I","Type II","Type IIIA","Type IIIB","Type IIIC",D,"A large contaminated wound with extensive soft-tissue damage and periosteal stripping requiring flap coverage is Type IIIB.

What is the most appropriate next investigation?","Repeat plain radiographs of the wrist immediately","CT of the wrist for bony detail","MRI of the wrist to assess occult fracture","Bone scan of the wrist","Ultrasound of the wrist",C,"Persistent snuffbox tenderness with normal initial radiographs suggests occult scaphoid fracture. MRI is the most sensitive and specific early test, evaluating bone edema and fracture line, and can change management promptly. CT is excellent for fracture characterization and union assessment but is less sensitive for early occult injury.",
46,"A 16-year-old overweight boy presents with 3 months of groin pain and limp. Exam shows obligate external rotation with hip flexion. AP and frog-leg lateral pelvis show posterior-inferior displacement of the femoral head relative to the neck. Most likely diagnosis?","Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease","Slipped capital femoral epiphysis","Developmental dysplasia of the hip","Femoroacetabular impingement","Transient synovitis",B,"SCFE typically affects overweight adolescents with hip or knee pain, limp, and obligate external rotation with flexion. Radiographs show posterior-inferior slip on frog-leg view. Perthes affects younger children with AVN. DDH is a pediatric instability condition. FAI presents in young adults with activity-related groin pain without epiphyseal slip. Transient synovitis is acute and self-limiting.",
47,"A 62-year-old diabetic presents with acute atraumatic hot, swollen knee and severe pain. Temperature 38.6 C. WBC 14 x10^9/L, CRP elevated. Best next step?","Urgent knee MRI with contrast","Start oral antibiotics and review in 48 hours","Urgent joint aspiration for cell count, Gram stain, and culture","Intra-articular steroid injection","Order uric acid level and treat as gout",C,"Septic arthritis is an orthopedic emergency. Urgent joint aspiration for synovial WBC, Gram stain, and culture guides immediate IV antibiotics and surgical washout as indicated. Delaying aspiration risks joint destruction. Steroids are contraindicated in suspected infection. Imaging and uric acid testing should not delay aspiration.",

Best immediate management?","Urgent lumbar MRI and emergent decompression within hours","Trial of oral steroids and outpatient MRI","Bed rest with NSAIDs and re-evaluation in 72 hours","Electrodiagnostic studies prior to imaging","CT lumbar spine without contrast only",A,"This presentation is classic for cauda equina syndrome with red flags (saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, bilateral deficits). Requires urgent MRI for diagnosis and emergent surgical decompression ideally within hours to improve neurological and bladder outcomes. Delays worsen prognosis. Conservative care, CT alone, or electrodiagnostics are inappropriate in this emergency.",
51,"A 45-year-old man falls from a ladder and lands on his outstretched hand. He presents with wrist pain and tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox. Radiographs are inconclusive. Which is the MOST appropriate next step?","CT scan of the wrist","MRI of the wrist","Repeat radiographs in 10–14 days","Bone scan","Ultrasound evaluation",C,"Scaphoid fractures are often radiographically occult initially; repeat radiographs after 10–14 days can reveal periosteal reaction confirming the fracture. CT or MRI can detect occult fractures earlier but are less cost-effective as first follow-up. Bone scan is sensitive but less specific and has limited availability acutely. Ultrasound is not reliable for scaphoid fractures."
52,"A 70-year-old woman presents after a low-energy fall with hip pain. Radiographs show an impacted femoral neck fracture. Which management is MOST appropriate?","Open reduction and internal fixation with sliding hip screw","Hemiarthroplasty","Total hip arthroplasty","Closed reduction and percutaneous screw fixation","Nonoperative management with traction",D,"Impacted femoral neck fractures in the elderly are stable and can be treated with closed reduction and percutaneous cannulated screw fixation to allow early mobilization. Sliding hip screw fixation is for displaced fractures. Hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty is reserved for displaced fractures or pre-existing arthrosis. Traction alone delays mobilization and increases morbidity."

What is the MOST likely complication?","Calcaneal fracture","Tibialis posterior rupture","Achilles tendon rupture","Insertional plantar fasciitis","Tarsal tunnel syndrome",C,"Corticosteroid injections near the Achilles tendon increase risk of tendon degeneration and rupture; a positive Thompson test confirms Achilles tendon rupture. Calcaneal fractures present differently. Tibialis posterior rupture affects inversion. Insertional plantar fasciitis causes heel pain but no gap. Tarsal tunnel syndrome causes neuropathic symptoms."
60,"A 35-year-old patient presents with severe pain and a firm, tense forearm after a supracondylar humerus fracture reduction. Pain is out of proportion, passive finger extension is limited, and compartment pressure is elevated. What is the NEXT BEST STEP?","Elevate the limb and observe","Remove cast and reassess","Administer IV opioids and continue observation","Fasciotomy of the affected compartment","Apply cold packs and compression",D,"Acute compartment syndrome requires emergent fasciotomy to decompress the compartment and prevent neurovascular compromise. Elevation alone worsens pressure. Removing the cast and analgesia are insufficient. Cold packs and compression exacerbate ischemia."
61,"A 45-year-old man falls from a ladder and lands on his outstretched hand. X-ray shows a distal radius fracture with dorsal angulation of 25°. According to the Frykman classification, this fracture is BEST categorized as:","Type I (extra-articular)","Type II (extra-articular with ulnar styloid)","Type III (intra-articular radiocarpal)","Type V (radioulnar joint involvement)","Type VII (both radiocarpal and radioulnar)","B","This distal radius fracture is extra-articular with an associated ulnar styloid fragment, fitting Frykman Type II.

After successful closed reduction, what nerve injury should be evaluated?","Musculocutaneous nerve","Axillary nerve","Radial nerve","Suprascapular nerve","Long thoracic nerve","B","Anterior shoulder dislocations commonly injure the axillary nerve as it wraps around the surgical neck of the humerus, leading to deltoid weakness and loss of sensation over the lateral shoulder."  
64,"A 28-year-old construction worker complains of numbness in his thumb, index, and middle fingers for 3 months. Phalen’s test reproduces symptoms in 10 seconds. Electrophysiology shows prolonged median nerve latency. The most appropriate next step is:","Immediate surgical release","Nighttime wrist splinting and activity modification","Corticosteroid injection into Guyon’s canal","Ulnar nerve transposition","Carpal tunnel corticosteroid injection","B","Initial treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome with moderate findings includes nocturnal splinting and modification of wrist-loading activities. Surgical release is reserved for severe or refractory cases."  
65,"A 72-year-old woman presents with hip pain after a ground-level fall. Radiograph shows a displaced femoral neck fracture. Which factor most predisposes to avascular necrosis if treated nonoperatively?","Age over 65","Displacement >2 mm","Intertrochanteric location","Extracapsular fracture","Low-energy mechanism","B","Displaced femoral neck fractures disrupt the retinacular vessels, significantly increasing risk of avascular necrosis if not surgically fixed. Age alone and low-energy mechanism are less predictive; intertrochanteric fractures are extracapsular with better blood supply."  
66,"A 22-year-old soccer player reports immediate knee pain after a tackle. He has a positive Lachman test and tenderness at the lateral joint line. MRI confirms an ACL tear and a lateral meniscus tear. Which treatment offers the BEST long-term stability?","ACL reconstruction alone","Meniscectomy alone","Concurrent ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair","Nonoperative management with bracing","Allograft meniscus transplant","C","Concurrent ACL reconstruction and repair of the meniscus restores knee stability and preserves meniscal function, reducing osteoarthritis risk. Meniscectomy alone worsens joint health; nonoperative management risks instability."  
67,"A 55-year-old diabetic patient presents with acute severe ankle pain, swelling, and tense compartments after a closed Weber B fracture. Distal pulses are palpable. The most appropriate management is:","Urgent fasciotomy","Immediate open reduction and internal fixation","External fixation only","Conservative casting","Delayed fixation after edema subsides","A","Compartment syndrome diagnosis mandates immediate fasciotomy to relieve pressure even if pulses are intact.

68,"A 65-year-old woman presents with acute onset hip pain, fever, and inability to weight bear. Lab shows WBC 15,000/mm³ and ESR 80 mm/hr. Hip aspiration yields turbid fluid with leukocyte count 100,000/mm³. The next best step is:","Start IV antibiotics and observe","Urgent surgical irrigation and debridement","Arthroscopic washout","NSAIDs and bed rest","Needle aspiration only","B","Septic arthritis requires prompt surgical drainage (open irrigation/debridement) plus IV antibiotics to prevent joint destruction. Needle aspiration alone is insufficient in the hip."  
69,"A 14-year-old obese boy presents with progressive hip pain and a limp. Radiograph shows posteroinferior displacement of the femoral epiphysis. The condition is:","Perthes disease","Developmental dysplasia of the hip","Slipped capital femoral epiphysis","Transient synovitis","Septic arthritis","C","Slipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs in obese adolescents with posteroinferior displacement of the femoral head. Perthes affects younger children with avascular necrosis."  
70,"A 40-year-old male smoker presents with severe leg pain and paresthesia after a tibial shaft fracture treated with intramedullary nailing 24 hours ago. Compartment pressures are elevated. The LEAST likely consequence of delayed fasciotomy is:","Volkmann ischemic contracture","Peripheral nerve damage","Nonunion of fracture","Rhabdomyolysis","Permanent muscle necrosis","C","Delayed fasciotomy leads to ischemic contracture, nerve injury, rhabdomyolysis, and muscle death. Fracture union rates are generally unaffected by compartment release timing."
