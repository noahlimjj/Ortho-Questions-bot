"57","How would you manage this fracture?","Immediate wound closure and casting","External fixation and then close the wound after 48 hours","Intramedullary nail fixation and then close the wound within 24 hours","Intramedullary nail fixation and then close the wound after 48 hours","External fixation and then close the window within 24 hours","B","Casting is only used for very stable grade 1 and 2 open fractures which have minimal soft tissue damage. Intramedullary nail fixation (open reduction internal fixation) is gold standard for closed and unstable tibial shaft fractures and most exposed fractures (types I, II, and IIIA GustiloAnderson) because it gives good stabilization, allows early ROM and facilitates fracture consolidation while preventing malalignment. (Superior healing compared to external fixation) However, it requires additional tissue dissection which is contraindicated in severe open fractures (IIIB and C) because additional exposure can cause partial loss of periosteal, cortical or intramedullary blood supply, increasing risk of infection. Hence, external fixation (Pin-to-bar/ circular/ hybrid) is superior in this case since it reduces likelihood of further infection and provides easy access to the wound. (for further assessment and debridement in the future) Lastly, the wound is usually left opened for 48 hours before closing up due to the dangers of tension & infection present in the first 2 days. This is mostly due to the worry of gas gangrene being formed by clostridial infections when there is extensive soft tissue damage and to ensure that there is viable soft tissue before closing up. However, recently new research papers suggest early wound closure could be a superior option  especially for grade IIIA and below and those which have been adequately debrided.

"50","An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman with hypertension and a history of gastroesophageal reflux–related esophageal stricture is found on routine screening to have a T-score of –2.6 SD. She experienced menarche at age 11, menopause 8 years ago, and was treated for endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago; her last mammogram and Pap smear 6 months ago were normal. She has no children, a maternal history of breast cancer, and currently takes lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. The physician recommends raloxifene for osteoporosis prophylaxis and asks about its specific adverse effects.","Mandibular osteonecrosis","Endometrial cancer","Osteosarcoma","Hypercholesterolemia","Deep venous thrombosis","E","Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as an estrogen agonist in bone and antagonist in breast and endometrium, reducing bone resorption without increasing endometrial cancer risk. However, it mimics estrogen's prothrombotic effects, significantly increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism such as deep venous thrombosis. It does not cause mandibular osteonecrosis or osteosarcoma, and it does not adversely affect lipid profiles to cause hypercholesterolemia. Patient counseling should emphasize VTE risk when starting raloxifene.",""
