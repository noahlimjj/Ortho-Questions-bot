Examination reveals tenderness over the ulnar styloid and a positive ECU synergy test with ballooning of a tendon on the dorsal ulnar wrist when attempting to spread fingers against resistance. What is the MOST likely diagnosis?","De Quervain tenosynovitis","Extensor carpi ulnaris tendinitis","Triangular fibrocartilage complex tear","Distal radioulnar joint arthritis","Ulnar styloid fracture nonunion","B","The clinical presentation with positive ECU synergy test (ballooning of the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon when spreading fingers against resistance) is pathognomonic for ECU tendinitis. The ECU synergy test specifically assesses the ECU tendon by having the patient spread their thumb, index, and middle fingers apart while the examiner attempts to squeeze them together. A positive test shows visible ballooning or subluxation of the ECU tendon on the dorsal ulnar aspect of the wrist. De Quervain tenosynovitis affects the first dorsal compartment (APL and EPB) on the radial side and is tested with Finkelstein's test. TFCC tears cause ulnar-sided pain but would have a positive fovea sign and piano key test rather than ECU synergy test.

"146","A 28-year-old woman falls on her outstretched hand and presents with wrist pain. X-rays show a scaphoid waist fracture with 2mm displacement. What is the MOST appropriate initial management?","Short arm cast for 6 weeks","Long arm thumb spica cast for 6 weeks then short arm cast","Open reduction and internal fixation with headless compression screw","MRI to assess vascularity before deciding treatment","Percutaneous screw fixation","C","Displaced scaphoid fractures (>1mm displacement) require operative management with open reduction and internal fixation using a headless compression screw. The 2mm displacement in this case is an absolute indication for surgery because non-operative management of displaced fractures leads to high rates of nonunion, AVN, and post-traumatic arthritis. Non-displaced scaphoid fractures (<1mm) can be managed conservatively with casting, but displaced fractures will not heal reliably without anatomic reduction and stable fixation. While scaphoid blood supply enters distally, MRI is not necessary prior to acute fixation of a displaced fracture. Percutaneous fixation alone without open reduction cannot achieve anatomic reduction of a displaced fracture. The proximal pole receives its blood supply retrograde from the distal scaphoid, making displaced waist fractures at high risk for AVN and nonunion if not properly reduced and stabilized.",""
"147","A 55-year-old diabetic woman complains of progressive numbness in her thumb, index, and middle fingers that wakes her at night. Tinel's test at the wrist is positive and Phalen's test reproduces symptoms after 30 seconds. Nerve conduction studies show prolonged distal motor latency of 4.8ms (normal <4.0ms) and sensory latency of 3.9ms (normal <3.5ms). What is the MOST appropriate next step in management?","Immediate carpal tunnel release surgery","Nighttime wrist splinting and NSAIDs for 6 weeks","Corticosteroid injection into carpal tunnel","EMG to assess for cervical radiculopathy","Vitamin B12 supplementation","B","This patient has mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome based on clinical findings and nerve conduction studies showing mild prolongation of latencies. Conservative management is appropriate as first-line treatment for mild-moderate CTS, including nighttime wrist splinting in neutral position and NSAIDs for 6-8 weeks. Studies show that 80% of mild-moderate CTS cases improve with conservative treatment. Surgery is indicated for severe CTS (thenar atrophy, constant numbness, motor latency >6ms), failed conservative treatment after 6-12 weeks, or patient preference. Corticosteroid injection can be used but is typically reserved for patients who fail splinting or as a diagnostic test. The positive Tinel's and Phalen's tests with classic distribution and positive NCS confirm the diagnosis of CTS, making cervical radiculopathy unlikely. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes peripheral neuropathy with glove-stocking distribution, not isolated median nerve symptoms.",""
"148","A 32-year-old mechanic sustains a crush injury to his hand. Four hours later, he develops severe pain in the hand despite adequate analgesia. On examination, the intrinsic muscles are tense, passive finger extension causes severe pain, and two-point discrimination is decreased. Compartment pressure measures 38mmHg. What is the MOST appropriate management?","Elevation and ice with repeat examination in 2 hours","Immediate fasciotomy of all hand compartments","Mannitol infusion and hyperbaric oxygen therapy","Observation with hourly neurovascular checks","Fasciotomy only if pressure exceeds 40mmHg","B","This patient has acute compartment syndrome of the hand, which is an orthopedic emergency requiring immediate fasciotomy. The classic signs are present: severe pain disproportionate to injury, pain with passive stretch, tense compartments, and sensory deficits. A compartment pressure of 38mmHg with clinical signs of compartment syndrome is an absolute indication for emergency fasciotomy. The hand has 10 compartments: 4 dorsal interossei, 3 palmar interossei, thenar, hypothenar, and adductor pollicis. Waiting for arbitrary pressure thresholds (like 40mmHg) or delta pressure calculations can lead to irreversible muscle necrosis and Volkmann's contracture. The diagnosis of compartment syndrome is primarily clinical, and pressures are adjunctive. Elevation may worsen perfusion by decreasing arteriovenous gradient. Fasciotomy must be performed within 6-8 hours of symptom onset to prevent permanent damage. All compartments should be released, typically through dorsal and palmar incisions. Mannitol and hyperbaric oxygen have no proven benefit and delay definitive treatment.",""
"149","A 6-year-old boy presents after jamming his finger in a door. X-ray shows a Salter-Harris type II fracture of the proximal phalanx with 35-degree apex volar angulation. What is the MOST appropriate management?","Closed reduction and buddy taping","Closed reduction and percutaneous K-wire fixation","Open reduction and plate fixation","Splinting without reduction due to remodeling potential","Observation only as this is a non-displaced fracture","B","Proximal phalanx fractures in children with >20 degrees of angulation require reduction and stabilization. Although pediatric bones have excellent remodeling potential, the proximal phalanx has limited remodeling capacity for angular deformities, and 35 degrees of apex volar angulation will result in functional impairment and cosmetic deformity. Salter-Harris type II fractures are inherently unstable due to the metaphyseal fragment. Closed reduction with percutaneous K-wire fixation is the gold standard for displaced pediatric phalangeal fractures, providing stable fixation while minimizing soft tissue disruption. Simple buddy taping after reduction would not provide adequate stability for this degree of displacement. Open reduction with plate fixation is unnecessarily invasive for this fracture pattern. Observation is inappropriate given the significant angulation. The acceptable angulation for proximal phalanx fractures is <10 degrees in the coronal plane and <20 degrees in the sagittal plane. Remodeling potential exists primarily in the plane of joint motion and in younger children, but cannot be relied upon for this degree of deformity.",""
"150","A 45-year-old woman presents with numbness in her ring and small fingers. Examination reveals weakness of finger abduction, positive Froment's sign, and a positive Wartenberg's sign. Tinel's test is positive at Guyon's canal. What is the MOST likely site of nerve compression?","Carpal tunnel","Cubital tunnel at the elbow","Guyon's canal (Zone II)","Arcade of Struthers","Pronator syndrome at the forearm","C","This patient has ulnar nerve compression at Guyon's canal (Zone II), which affects the deep motor branch while sparing sensation to the dorsum of the hand (dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve branches proximal to Guyon's canal). Froment's sign (thumb IP flexion when attempting key pinch due to adductor pollicis weakness with FPL compensation) and Wartenberg's sign (abducted small finger due to unopposed EDM with weak palmar interosseous) indicate ulnar nerve motor dysfunction. Positive Tinel's at Guyon's canal localizes the compression. Guyon's canal has three zones: Zone I affects both motor and sensory, Zone II affects only deep motor branch (as in this case), and Zone III affects only superficial sensory branch. Cubital tunnel syndrome would include dorsal hand sensory loss and often causes medial elbow symptoms. Carpal tunnel affects median nerve distribution (thumb, index, middle fingers). Arcade of Struthers and pronator syndrome are not ulnar nerve compression sites. The preservation of sensation to the dorsal hand in this case specifically indicates compression distal to the branching of the dorsal ulnar cutaneous nerve.",""
"152","A 19-year-old basketball player sustains a hyperextension injury to his index finger. He is unable to actively flex the DIP joint, but passive motion is full. The finger is held in slight hyperextension at the DIP. X-rays are normal. What structure is MOST likely injured?","Flexor digitorum superficialis","Flexor digitorum profundus","Central slip of extensor mechanism","Volar plate","Terminal extensor tendon","B","Inability to actively flex the DIP joint indicates rupture of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon, which is the only structure that flexes the DIP joint. This typically occurs with forceful hyperextension while the finger is actively flexing (jersey finger). The FDP test is performed by stabilizing the proximal and middle phalanges in extension and asking the patient to flex the DIP joint. The ring finger FDP is most commonly affected, but any finger can be involved. FDS flexes only the PIP joint and would not affect DIP motion. Central slip injury causes boutonniere deformity with PIP flexion and DIP hyperextension, opposite to this presentation. Volar plate injuries cause PIP hyperextension instability but preserve active DIP flexion. Terminal extensor tendon injury (mallet finger) causes inability to extend, not flex, the DIP joint. Leddy and Packer classification: Type I (tendon retracts to palm, disrupts vincula, urgent surgery needed), Type II (tendon retracts to PIP, most common, surgery within 7-10 days), Type III (bony avulsion fragment prevents retraction, surgery within 6-8 weeks).

"153","A 42-year-old office worker presents with pain at the base of her thumb, worse with gripping and pinching. Examination reveals tenderness over the radial styloid and a positive Finkelstein's test. Conservative management fails after 8 weeks. What is the MOST appropriate next step?","Corticosteroid injection into the first dorsal compartment","Thumb spica splinting for additional 6 weeks","Surgical release of the first dorsal compartment","MRI of the wrist to rule out scaphoid pathology","Corticosteroid injection into the CMC joint","A","After failed conservative management of De Quervain tenosynovitis, corticosteroid injection into the first dorsal compartment is the appropriate next step before considering surgery. Studies show that steroid injection provides relief in 60-90% of cases who fail splinting. The injection should be given into the first dorsal compartment containing the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendons, taking care to inject around (not into) the tendons and to identify and treat any separate EPB subcompartment. Finkelstein's test (thumb tucked in palm, ulnar deviation causes pain) confirms the diagnosis. If injection fails or symptoms recur, surgical release is indicated with careful identification and release of all APL and EPB subcompartments while protecting the superficial radial nerve branches. Extended splinting beyond 6-8 weeks without additional intervention is unlikely to provide benefit. MRI is not necessary with classic presentation and positive Finkelstein's test. CMC joint injection would not address first dorsal compartment tenosynovitis, though CMC arthritis can coexist and should be evaluated separately with grind test.",""
"154","A 50-year-old man sustains a high-pressure paint gun injection injury to his index finger. He presents 3 hours after injury with minimal external signs of trauma but complains of severe pain and swelling. What is the MOST appropriate immediate management?","Observation with hand elevation and antibiotics","Immediate surgical debridement and decompression","X-ray to identify foreign material then outpatient follow-up","Soaking in warm water and oral antibiotics","Incision and drainage in the emergency department","B","High-pressure injection injuries are devastating injuries requiring immediate surgical debridement and decompression. Despite minimal external appearance (small puncture wound), these injuries cause extensive tissue damage from the injected material (paint, grease, oil) spreading along fascial planes, causing chemical inflammation, ischemia, and necrosis. Paint and organic solvents are particularly toxic. The low threshold for tissue injury combined with the closed-space nature of digital anatomy creates a surgical emergency. Delay in treatment (>6 hours) significantly increases amputation rates (up to 60% vs 10% if treated early). Emergency surgical management includes wide debridement of all affected tissue, compartment release, thorough irrigation, and leaving wounds open. Multiple staged debridements are often necessary. Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics should be given, but surgery cannot be delayed. Simple drainage is inadequate as the injected material spreads diffusely. X-rays should not delay surgery but may help identify extent of material spread. The Ryzewicz-Stern classification helps predict outcomes based on material type (organic solvents worse than water-based), pressure, and anatomic location.",""

According to the Garden classification, what is the most likely grade of this fracture?","Grade I (incomplete)","Grade II (complete, non-displaced)","Grade III (complete, partially displaced)","Grade IV (complete, fully displaced)","Grade V (pathologic fracture)","D","The clinical presentation of a femoral neck fracture with the hip held in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation is characteristic of a displaced fracture. The Garden classification system grades femoral neck fractures based on the degree of displacement: Grade I is incomplete, Grade II is complete but non-displaced, Grade III is complete with partial displacement, and Grade IV is complete with full displacement. The description of a fracture line perpendicular to the femoral shaft with inability to bear weight and the classic deformity position indicates complete displacement (Grade IV). Grade III would show some alignment maintained, while Grade IV shows complete loss of alignment. This distinction is critical as Grade IV fractures have significantly higher rates of avascular necrosis and nonunion.",""
"294","A 28-year-old male presents with acute left knee pain and swelling after a non-contact injury during soccer. He reports hearing a 'pop' and feeling the knee 'give way.' On examination, there is a large effusion, positive Lachman test with a soft endpoint, and positive anterior drawer test. MRI confirms an acute anterior cruciate ligament tear. Which of the following associated injuries is MOST commonly found in conjunction with this ACL tear?","Posterior cruciate ligament tear","Lateral collateral ligament tear","Medial meniscus tear","Patellar dislocation","Posterolateral corner injury","C","The medial meniscus tear is the most commonly associated injury with acute ACL tears, occurring in approximately 50-70% of cases and forming part of the classic 'unhappy triad' (or 'terrible triad' when including MCL injury). This association is thought to be due to the mechanism of injury and the biomechanical changes that occur with ACL insufficiency. PCL tears are less common and typically occur with different mechanisms (dashboard injuries). LCL and posterolateral corner injuries are associated with different injury patterns. Patellar dislocation would present with different clinical findings and apprehension on examination. Understanding this association is important for comprehensive treatment planning and patient counseling.",""
"295","A 72-year-old woman with a history of chronic corticosteroid use for rheumatoid arthritis presents with insidious onset of right hip pain and progressive loss of hip motion. X-ray shows a focal area of lucency with a sclerotic halo in the weight-bearing portion of the femoral head. MRI demonstrates bone marrow edema. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Osteoarthritis of the hip","Septic arthritis","Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SPONK)","Avascular necrosis of the femoral head","Paget's disease of bone","D","This clinical presentation is classic for avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. The key features include: chronic corticosteroid use (major risk factor), insidious onset, progressive loss of motion, and imaging findings of a focal lucency with sclerotic halo in the weight-bearing portion of the femoral head. The bone marrow edema on MRI is consistent with early AVN. While SPONK (spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee) presents similarly with focal necrosis and sclerotic halo, it occurs in the knee, not the hip. Osteoarthritis would show joint space narrowing and osteophytes rather than focal lucency. Septic arthritis would present acutely with fever and systemic symptoms. Paget's disease shows characteristic 'cotton wool' appearance. AVN of the femoral head is a serious complication of corticosteroid use and requires prompt intervention to prevent collapse.",""
"296","A 16-year-old overweight boy presents with right knee pain that he attributes to a sports injury. However, on careful history, he reports pain referred to the medial knee, and on examination, he has limited hip internal rotation and pain with hip flexion and adduction. A 'frog lateral' radiograph of the hip is obtained. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Medial meniscus tear","Slipped upper femoral epiphysis","Osgood-Schlatter disease","Patellar tendinitis","Iliotibial band syndrome","B","This presentation is classic for slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SCFE), which is frequently missed because patients present with knee pain rather than hip pain. Key diagnostic features include: adolescent male, obesity, pain referred to the medial knee, limited hip internal rotation, and pain with hip flexion and adduction. The 'frog lateral' radiograph is the diagnostic imaging of choice and will show the characteristic deformity where the femoral head is displaced medially and posteriorly relative to the femoral neck. SCFE is a surgical emergency requiring urgent stabilization to prevent further slippage and complications such as avascular necrosis and early osteoarthritis. The contralateral hip is at high risk and requires prophylactic pinning in many cases. Failure to recognize this diagnosis can lead to significant morbidity.",""
"297","A 45-year-old man presents with chronic medial knee pain localized to the medial femoral condyle. He reports that the knee sometimes feels 'locked' due to pain and effusion. Physical examination reveals focal tenderness over the medial femoral condyle. Plain radiographs appear normal, but MRI shows bone marrow edema in the medial femoral condyle with early flattening of the weight-bearing surface. What is the most appropriate next step in management?","Immediate arthroscopic debridement","Surgical osteochondral allograft transplantation","Conservative management with crutches, NSAIDs, and physical therapy","High tibial osteotomy","Total knee arthroplasty","C","This clinical presentation is consistent with spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SPONK), specifically Stage 2 disease based on the flattening of the weight-bearing portion. The patient has focal tenderness on the medial femoral condyle, normal plain radiographs initially, and MRI findings of bone marrow edema with early flattening. SPONK typically presents in middle-aged patients with insidious onset of pain. The staging system guides management: Stage 1 (normal X-rays, positive bone scan, bone edema on MRI) and Stage 2 (flattening) are typically managed conservatively with crutches, NSAIDs, and physical therapy, which often yields good symptomatic results. Operative interventions such as arthroscopic debridement, osteochondral allograft, high tibial osteotomy, or arthroplasty are reserved for advanced stages (3-5) or failed conservative management. Early recognition and conservative treatment can prevent progression to collapse.",""
"298","A 58-year-old woman presents with progressive right hip pain and stiffness over 6 months. She reports pain with hip flexion and internal rotation. On examination, she has limited hip abduction and external rotation. X-ray shows joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis. Laboratory studies show normal inflammatory markers. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Rheumatoid arthritis","Septic arthritis","Osteoarthritis of the hip","Avascular necrosis","Inflammatory bowel disease-associated arthritis","C","This presentation is classic for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. Key diagnostic features include: middle-aged to older patient, insidious onset of progressive pain and stiffness, pain with hip flexion and internal rotation (classic pattern), limited abduction and external rotation (typical motion loss pattern), and imaging findings of joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and subchondral sclerosis. Normal inflammatory markers help exclude rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies. Septic arthritis would present acutely with fever and systemic symptoms. AVN would show focal lucency with sclerotic halo rather than diffuse joint space narrowing. OA is the most common cause of hip pain in adults over 60 but can occur at any age. Management typically involves NSAIDs, physical therapy, activity modification, and consideration of hip arthroplasty for advanced disease.",""
"299","A 35-year-old female athlete presents with acute left knee pain and swelling after a valgus stress injury with external rotation. On examination, there is a positive Lachman test, positive anterior drawer test, and positive valgus stress test at 30 degrees of flexion. Which structure is LEAST likely to be injured in this mechanism?","Anterior cruciate ligament","Medial collateral ligament","Medial meniscus","Posterior cruciate ligament","Medial joint capsule","D","The mechanism described (valgus stress with external rotation) is classic for the 'unhappy triad' or 'terrible triad' injury pattern, which involves the ACL, MCL, and medial meniscus. The positive Lachman and anterior drawer tests confirm ACL injury. The positive valgus stress test at 30 degrees indicates MCL injury. This mechanism commonly causes medial meniscus tears as well. The posterior cruciate ligament is least likely to be injured in this valgus external rotation mechanism. PCL injuries typically occur with posterior directed forces (dashboard injuries, falls on flexed knee) or hyperextension. The valgus stress actually protects the PCL from injury. Understanding injury mechanisms and their associated patterns is crucial for comprehensive evaluation and treatment planning in knee injuries.",""
"300","A 22-year-old male presents with acute right knee pain and swelling after a direct blow to the lateral knee while playing football. On examination, there is a positive Lachman test and positive posterior drawer test. Varus stress testing at 30 degrees shows increased laxity. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Isolated anterior cruciate ligament tear","Isolated posterior cruciate ligament tear","Combined ACL and posterolateral corner injury","Isolated medial collateral ligament tear","Isolated lateral collateral ligament tear","C","This presentation indicates a combined injury pattern. The positive Lachman test confirms ACL injury. The positive posterior drawer test suggests PCL involvement, but in the context of a direct lateral blow with increased varus laxity at 30 degrees, this indicates posterolateral corner (PLC) injury. The posterolateral corner includes the lateral collateral ligament, popliteus muscle, and popliteofibular ligament. A direct lateral blow mechanism commonly causes combined ACL and PLC injuries. The varus laxity at 30 degrees (rather than 0 degrees) is more specific for PLC injury, as isolated LCL injury typically shows varus laxity at 0 degrees. Combined ACL-PLC injuries are more complex than isolated ACL tears and require careful surgical planning. Failure to recognize and treat PLC injuries can result in poor outcomes after ACL reconstruction alone.",""
"302","A 12-year-old boy presents with anterior knee pain below the patella that worsens with running and jumping. On examination, there is tenderness over the tibial tuberosity, and X-ray shows fragmentation and irregularity of the tibial tuberosity with surrounding soft tissue swelling. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Patellar tendinitis","Osgood-Schlatter disease","Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease","Patellofemoral pain syndrome","Anterior knee impingement","B","This presentation is classic for Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD), which is an apophysitis of the tibial tuberosity occurring in adolescent athletes during growth spurts. Key diagnostic features include: adolescent male, anterior knee pain below the patella (at the tibial tuberosity), pain with running and jumping, tenderness over the tibial tuberosity, and X-ray findings of fragmentation and irregularity of the tibial tuberosity with surrounding soft tissue swelling. OSD is self-limited and typically resolves with skeletal maturity. Management is conservative, including activity modification, ice, NSAIDs, and physical therapy focusing on quadriceps and hamstring flexibility. Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease is similar but occurs at the inferior pole of the patella. Patellar tendinitis would show tendon inflammation rather than tuberosity fragmentation. OSD is one of the most common causes of anterior knee pain in adolescent athletes and is generally benign with excellent prognosis.",""

Which of the following is the most important prognostic factor for this condition?","Patient age","Duration of steroid use","Extent of talar dome involvement","Presence of ankle arthritis","Body mass index","C","The extent of talar dome involvement is the most critical prognostic factor in osteonecrosis of the talus. The Hawkins classification system grades osteonecrosis based on the percentage of talar dome affected. Lesions involving less than 50% of the talar dome have better prognosis with conservative management, while lesions exceeding 50% have high rates of collapse and progression to post-traumatic arthritis.

Which nerve is MOST commonly injured with this injury pattern?","Axillary nerve","Radial nerve","Musculocutaneous nerve","Suprascapular nerve","Long thoracic nerve","A","Anterior shoulder dislocation is the most common type of shoulder dislocation. The axillary nerve is injured in approximately 5-10% of anterior dislocations, particularly in older patients. Axillary nerve injury presents with loss of shoulder abduction (deltoid paralysis) and sensory loss over the lateral shoulder. The radial nerve is not typically injured with anterior dislocation. Musculocutaneous and suprascapular nerve injuries are rare with this mechanism. Long thoracic nerve injury causes winging of the scapula, which is not associated with anterior dislocation.",""
"407","A 52-year-old woman with a history of diabetes presents with insidious onset of shoulder pain and progressive loss of active range of motion over 3 months. Passive range of motion is also limited. MRI shows no rotator cuff tear. Which diagnosis is MOST likely?","Rotator cuff tear","Adhesive capsulitis","Subacromial impingement","Acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis","Biceps tendinopathy","B","Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) presents with insidious onset of pain followed by progressive loss of both active and passive range of motion. The key distinguishing feature is that BOTH active and passive ROM are limited, unlike impingement where passive ROM is preserved. Diabetes is a known risk factor. MRI typically shows capsular thickening and fibrosis but no rotator cuff tear. The condition progresses through three phases: freezing (pain), frozen (stiffness), and thawing (recovery). Rotator cuff tear would show imaging abnormality. Impingement would preserve passive ROM. AC joint OA and biceps tendinopathy would not cause global ROM loss.",""
"408","A 35-year-old male presents with lateral elbow pain that worsens with gripping and wrist extension.

The ECRB originates from the lateral epicondyle and is responsible for wrist extension. The clinical presentation of pain with resisted wrist extension and tenderness over the lateral epicondyle is classic for ECRB involvement. The ECRL is also involved but less commonly than ECRB. Flexor carpi radialis is involved in medial epicondylitis. Extensor digitorum communis can be involved but is not the primary structure. Anconeus involvement is rare in lateral epicondylitis.",""
"409","A 42-year-old construction worker sustains a crush injury to his right arm with severe swelling in the forearm. He develops severe pain out of proportion to clinical findings and pain with passive finger extension. Compartment pressures are measured at 65 mmHg with a diastolic blood pressure of 75 mmHg. What is the MOST appropriate next step?","Administer IV fluids and elevate the arm","Apply ice and compression dressing","Perform emergency fasciotomy","Obtain CT angiography to rule out vascular injury","Administer high-dose corticosteroids","C","This clinical presentation is consistent with acute compartment syndrome of the forearm. The key diagnostic finding is pain out of proportion to clinical findings and pain with passive stretch of muscles in the affected compartment (passive finger extension stretches the flexor compartment). The compartment pressure of 65 mmHg with a diastolic BP of 75 mmHg gives a perfusion pressure of only 10 mmHg (normal is >30 mmHg), which is diagnostic of compartment syndrome. Emergency fasciotomy is the definitive treatment and must be performed urgently to prevent permanent tissue damage, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury. Elevation and ice are contraindicated as they may worsen perfusion. CT angiography is not indicated. Corticosteroids have no role in compartment syndrome management.",""
"410","A 58-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presents with progressive shoulder pain and weakness. MRI shows a large rotator cuff tear with significant muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration. The tear involves the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Which finding would BEST predict a poor outcome with rotator cuff repair?","Tear size >3 cm","Fatty infiltration grade 3 or 4","Patient age >55 years","Presence of osteoarthritis","Duration of symptoms >12 months","B","Fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles is one of the most important prognostic factors for rotator cuff repair outcomes. Goutallier classification grades fatty infiltration from 0-4, with grade 3 or 4 (moderate to severe) associated with poor functional outcomes and high re-tear rates even after successful repair. This is because fatty infiltration represents irreversible muscle degeneration and loss of contractile tissue. While tear size >3 cm is associated with higher re-tear rates, it is not as predictive of poor functional outcome as fatty infiltration. Age >55 is a risk factor but not as strong as fatty infiltration. Osteoarthritis and symptom duration are less predictive than fatty infiltration grade.",""
"411","A 24-year-old male presents after a fall on an outstretched hand with severe wrist pain and swelling. X-rays show a distal radius fracture with dorsal angulation and dorsal displacement. Closed reduction is performed. Which complication is MOST commonly associated with this fracture pattern?","Posterior interosseous nerve injury","Anterior interosseous nerve injury","Extensor pollicis longus rupture","Flexor carpi radialis rupture","Median nerve compression","C","This clinical presentation describes a Colles' fracture (distal radius fracture with dorsal angulation and displacement). The most common late complication of Colles' fracture is extensor pollicis longus (EPL) rupture, which occurs in 1-5% of cases. The EPL tendon ruptures as it passes around Lister's tubercle due to attrition from the fracture edges or from ischemia. Patients present with loss of thumb IP joint extension and inability to extend the thumb. This typically occurs weeks to months after the initial injury. Posterior interosseous nerve injury would present acutely with wrist and finger extension weakness. Anterior interosseous nerve injury causes loss of thumb IP and index finger DIP flexion. Flexor carpi radialis rupture is rare. Median nerve compression can occur but is less common than EPL rupture.",""
"413","A 32-year-old male presents with acute posterior shoulder pain after a seizure. He reports severe pain with any movement. X-rays show a posterior shoulder dislocation with a reverse Hill-Sachs lesion. Which mechanism BEST explains the posterior dislocation in this patient?","Anterior deltoid muscle contraction","Pectoralis major muscle contraction","Infraspinatus muscle contraction","Latissimus dorsi muscle contraction","Serratus anterior muscle contraction","B","Posterior shoulder dislocations are rare (2-4% of all shoulder dislocations) and are classically associated with seizures, electrocution, and high-energy trauma. During a seizure, the powerful pectoralis major muscle contracts forcefully, internally rotating and adducting the shoulder, which drives the humeral head posteriorly. The reverse Hill-Sachs lesion (compression fracture on the anterior humeral head) is pathognomonic for posterior dislocation. Anterior deltoid contraction would not cause posterior dislocation. Infraspinatus is an external rotator and would resist posterior dislocation. Latissimus dorsi assists with internal rotation but is not the primary driver. Serratus anterior is not involved in this mechanism. Posterior dislocations are often missed on initial X-rays and require axillary or Y-view radiographs for diagnosis.",""
"414","A 28-year-old man falls on his outstretched hand and presents with wrist pain and tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox. Initial wrist X-rays are negative. What is the most appropriate next step in management?","Discharge with reassurance","Immobilize in a thumb spica splint and arrange orthopedic follow-up","Immediate surgical fixation","Repeat X-rays in 6 weeks without immobilization","Order a CT scan immediately","B","Scaphoid fractures may not be visible on initial X-rays. If clinical suspicion is high (snuffbox tenderness), immobilization in a thumb spica splint and orthopedic follow-up are indicated to prevent nonunion and avascular necrosis.
