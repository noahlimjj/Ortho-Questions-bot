41,"A 72-year-old woman falls from standing height and presents with left hip pain and inability to bear weight. AP pelvis shows a displaced femoral neck fracture with loss of femoral head-neck continuity. She walks independently prior to the fall. What is the most appropriate definitive management?","Dynamic hip screw fixation","Cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty","Uncemented total hip arthroplasty","Cemented total hip arthroplasty","Percutaneous cannulated screw fixation",D,"Displaced femoral neck fracture in an active, independent elderly patient is best treated with arthroplasty to reduce reoperation risk compared to fixation. Cemented stems reduce periprosthetic fracture and improve early function in the elderly. Total hip arthroplasty is preferred over hemiarthroplasty in higher-demand community ambulators. Cemented THA is therefore most appropriate. DHS and cannulated screws have high nonunion/AVN rates in displaced fractures. Uncemented THA has higher intraoperative fracture risk in osteoporotic bone."
42,"A 28-year-old motorcyclist sustains an open midshaft tibial fracture with periosteal stripping and 10 cm wound contamination with soil. After resuscitation, what is the correct Gustilo-Anderson classification?","Type I","Type II","Type IIIA","Type IIIB","Type IIIC",D,"A large contaminated wound with extensive soft-tissue damage and periosteal stripping requiring flap coverage is Type IIIB. Type IIIA has adequate soft tissue for coverage. Type IIIC includes arterial injury requiring repair. Type I and II reflect smaller wounds with less soft-tissue damage."
43,"A 45-year-old man presents with back pain after a fall from 3 meters. CT shows a burst fracture at L1 with retropulsed fragments and 35% vertebral height loss. Neurologically intact. MRI shows intact posterior ligamentous complex. Best management?","Posterior short-segment fixation and fusion","Anterior corpectomy and fusion","Thoracolumbosacral orthosis with close follow-up","Combined anterior-posterior stabilization","Percutaneous vertebroplasty",C,"Thoracolumbar burst fracture with intact PLC and no neurological deficit can be managed nonoperatively with TLSO if deformity and canal compromise are acceptable.

Which nerve is most likely injured?","Radial nerve","Axillary nerve","Musculocutaneous nerve","Suprascapular nerve","Spinal accessory nerve",B,"The axillary nerve is commonly injured with anterior shoulder dislocations, presenting with deltoid weakness (abduction) and sensory loss over the 'regimental badge' area. Radial nerve injury affects wrist/finger extension. Musculocutaneous nerve affects elbow flexion and lateral forearm sensation. Suprascapular nerve affects supraspinatus/infraspinatus. Spinal accessory nerve affects trapezius function."

What is the most appropriate next investigation?","Repeat plain radiographs of the wrist immediately","CT of the wrist for bony detail","MRI of the wrist to assess occult fracture","Bone scan of the wrist","Ultrasound of the wrist",C,"Persistent snuffbox tenderness with normal initial radiographs suggests occult scaphoid fracture. MRI is the most sensitive and specific early test, evaluating bone edema and fracture line, and can change management promptly.

Best next step?","Urgent knee MRI with contrast","Start oral antibiotics and review in 48 hours","Urgent joint aspiration for cell count, Gram stain, and culture","Intra-articular steroid injection","Order uric acid level and treat as gout",C,"Septic arthritis is an orthopedic emergency. Urgent joint aspiration for synovial WBC, Gram stain, and culture guides immediate IV antibiotics and surgical washout as indicated. Delaying aspiration risks joint destruction. Steroids are contraindicated in suspected infection. Imaging and uric acid testing should not delay aspiration."

Posterior malleolus fragments involving about 20% are assessed intraoperatively; fixation is based on instability, displacement, and syndesmotic contribution. Fixing the posterior fragment can restore syndesmotic stability. Casting is inappropriate for unstable injuries."

Best immediate management?","Urgent lumbar MRI and emergent decompression within hours","Trial of oral steroids and outpatient MRI","Bed rest with NSAIDs and re-evaluation in 72 hours","Electrodiagnostic studies prior to imaging","CT lumbar spine without contrast only",A,"This presentation is classic for cauda equina syndrome with red flags (saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, bilateral deficits). Requires urgent MRI for diagnosis and emergent surgical decompression ideally within hours to improve neurological and bladder outcomes. Delays worsen prognosis. Conservative care, CT alone, or electrodiagnostics are inappropriate in this emergency."
