a. Color
b. Consistency 
c. Compressibility 
d. Capacity to bleed
e. Contractility
f. 
Ans: C
Excise all devitalized tissue. Muscle provides an excellent environment for bacteria to flourish. Thus, extensive debridement of contaminated and devascularized tissue should be completed. Attention to the classic �C�s� of muscle viability can assist the decision for excision: color, consistency, contractility, and capacity to bleed. Caution should be taken with excision of tendons and ligaments.

4. How would you manage this fracture?
a. Immediate wound closure and casting
b. External fixation and then close the wound after 48 hours
c. Intramedullary nail fixation and then close the wound within 24 hours
d. Intramedullary nail fixation and then close the wound after 48 hours
e. External fixation and then close the wound within 24 hours
Ans: B
Casting is only used for very stable grade 1 and 2 open fractures which have minimal soft tissue damage. 

Intramedullary nail fixation (open reduction internal fixation) is gold standard for closed and unstable tibial shaft fractures and most exposed fractures (types I, II, and IIIA Gustilo�Anderson) because it gives good stabilization, allows early ROM and facilitates fracture consolidation while preventing malalignment. (Superior healing compared to external fixation) However, it requires additional tissue dissection which is contraindicated in severe open fractures (IIIB and C) because additional exposure can cause partial loss of periosteal, cortical or intramedullary blood supply, increasing risk of infection. Hence, external fixation (Pin-to-bar/ circular/ hybrid) is superior in this case since it reduces likelihood of further infection and provides easy access to the wound. (for further assessment and debridement in the future)

Lastly, the wound is usually left opened for 48 hours before closing up due to the dangers of tension & infection present in the first 2 days. This is mostly due to the worry of gas gangrene being formed by clostridial infections when there is extensive soft tissue damage and to ensure that there is viable soft tissue before closing up. However, recently new research papers suggest early wound closure could be a superior option � especially for grade IIIA and below and those which have been adequately debrided. So, continue reading  research articles to stay relevant and uptodate! 


5. The external fixation was done and the surgery went well.  The pateint�s trachea was extubated and he was then transported to the Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU). However, during the first hour, his oxygen saturation dropped to 85-90% and hence he is delivered oxygen at 2 litres/min via nasal cannula. However, the saturation does not improve, and the patient seems to develop respiratory distress and appears to be in a confused state. On closer inspection, petechial rash was seen over the patient�s chest and he had subconjunctival hemorrhage too. 

What is the most likely cause of this set of symptoms?

a. Pulmonary embolism
b. Sepsis
c. Fat embolism
d. Pneumonia
Ans: C
Fat embolism syndrome (FES) typically manifests 24 to 72 hours after the initial insult, but may rarely occur as early as 12 hours or as late as two weeks after the inciting event. Affected patients develop a classic triad: hypoxemia (most common symptom and may mimic ARDS), neurologic abnormalities (range from the development of an acute confusional state and altered level of consciousness to seizures and focal deficits) , and a petechial rash (most often on the nondependent regions of the body including the head, neck, anterior thorax, axillae, and sub-conjunctiva). 

6. After 6 months,  you reassess the patient�s fracture and you find that the patient experiences non-union since the healing of the bones has ceased.Which is not a common site of non-union?

a. Distal tibia
b. Scaphoid
c. Neck of femur
d. Lateral humeral condyle
e. Midshaft femur

Ans: E
Distal tibia has a poor muscle coverage while scaphoid bone and neck of femur have poor blood supplies esp if the fracture occurs in a specific area which causes avascular necrosis. 



MCQ questions
1. What is the order of the normal healing process of bones?

a. Hematoma, soft callus, hard callus, woven bone, lamellar bone
b. soft callus, hard callus, lamellar bone, woven bone
c. Hematoma, soft callus, lamellar bone, hard callus, woven bone
d. Soft callus, hematoma, hard callus, lamellar bone, woven bone
e. Hematoma, soft callus, hard callus, lamellar bone, woven bone
Ans: A


2. A 47 year old woman, who had just finished her surgical fixation for a complex distal radial fracture of the right arm 12 hours ago, complains of severe forearm pain in the PACU. The anesthetist suspects that the increasing pain is caused by an incomplete nerve block and hence she performs another nerve block with ropivacaine. However, the patient was still screaming due to severe pain and hence the anesthetist came to you. Being Dr. Ooguway, the Master of Medicine, what would be the least appropriate next step in this case?
a.  Check if there is any tingling or pin prick sensation over the area
b. Check for pale skin tone over the area
c. Use a needle manometer
d. Passively extend the muscles and see whether there is increase in pain
e. Check for any weakness in movement of fingers

Ans:C 
This is commonly used for unconscious/obtunded patients in clinical practice because you can�t elicit pain history from them. However, if the patient complains of excruciating pain and if in the right clinical context, emergency management for compartment syndrome can be performed. Check for 5 �P�s if suspect compartment syndrome � Pain, Paresthesia, pressure, pallor, pulselessness. 

3. Which one of the following is false about the clinical examinations of an ACL tear?
a. Posterior drawer is negative
b. Anterior drawer is positive 
c. There is posterior sag of the knee
d. Lachman test is positive 
e. Pivot shift is positive
Ans: C

Posterior sag and drawer are positive for PCL tear. 

4. Which one of the following is not commonly used as a graft for ACL reconstruction?
a. Semitendinosis
b. Gracilis
c. Patella tendon 
d. Biceps femoris
Ans: D

5. (https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2013/bcr-2012-007614 )A 14-year-old man presented to the emergency department with 3?days of progressively worsening right knee pain that was exacerbated by movement. The patient played basketball and had a history of asthma, but he denied any recent trauma or prior knee pain. Systemic symptoms, including fever, weight changes and fatigue, were absent. On examination, he had tenderness at the tibial tuberosity and a small effusion, but no overlying erythema or limited range of motion. A sliver-like osseous density anterior to apophysis of the tibial tuberosity was see on the knee x-ray. What would you not expect to find in the x-ray?
A. Calcification within patellar tendon
B. Displacement or fragmentation of tibial apophysis
C. Soft tissue edema proximal to tibial tuberosity
D. Loose bodies in knee joint

 
 Ans:D

6. A 40-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because she has pain in the right arm 2 hours after she fell in her home. Physical examination shows swelling and deformity of the right arm. X-ray studies show a spiral midshaft fracture of the humerus. Which of the following would most likely be elicited during physical examination. 

A. The patient is unable to dorsiflex the wrist.
B. Presents with the bishop�s hand/ ape hand when asked to make a fist
C. Presents with tingling over the little finger
D. Has trouble abducting her arm
E. Numbness over the lateral aspect of the forearm

Ans: A 
The radial nerve courses posterior to the middle third of the humeral shaft (sits in the radial groove) and is prone to injury with fractures of the midshaft of the humerus. Sensory distribution of the radial nerve includes the first dorsal web space of the hand, and motor innervation includes the dorsal forearm extensor muscles, including those of the wrist. 
B is incorrect since it refers to median nerve injury ? not a common nerve to be injured in this context. This nerve courses through the medial aspect of the arm between the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles. 
C is incorrect since it refers to ulnar nerve injury ? not a common nerve to be injured in this context. This nerve courses through the arm relatively parallel to the median nerve and is not in proximity to the humerus at the level of the fracture.
D is incorrect since it refers to axillary nerve injury ? is located posterior to the humeral neck
E is incorrect since it refers to musculocutaneous nerve injury ? not commonly injured. 

7. A 50-year-old man, with a PMHx of long standing diabetes, comes to the sports medicine office because he has pain in his right hip and thigh that has been worsening since he fell while working in his yard two weeks ago. He is also noted to febrile with a temperature of 38.3�C. Erythema and warmth are noted over the lateral aspect of the right hip and the proximal aspect of the right thigh. Full range of motion of the hip is noted, and distal sensation and pulses are intact. On laboratory studies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 29 mm/hr (normal: 0-15 m/hr). Results of full blood cell count are within normal limits. X-ray studies of the hip show a slightly raised periosteum in the proximal femoral shaft. Which of the following additional diagnostic studies is most appropriate?

(A) CT scan
(B) Indium 111 bone scan
(C) MRI
(D) Technetium 99m bone scan
(E) Ultrasonography

The correct answer is C. The clinical presentation is characteristic of osteomyelitis, and MRI is the most appropriate study to confirm this diagnosis because it shows loss or blurring of normal fat planes, periostitis, marrow edema and periosteal elevation. A is incorrect because this study is not sensitive for acute osteomyelitis. Option B, indium 111 bone scan, and Option D, technetium 99m bone scan, are incorrect because although these studies might show increased metabolic activity in patients with osteomyelitis, this finding is not distinguishable from post-traumatic injury, cancer, or postoperative findings. Option E, ultrasonography, is incorrect because this study can only show fluid collection next to bone, which is not distinguishable from a traumatic response. 

8. An 8 year old girl, Eva, presents with her mother after falling from a trampoline yesterday. She has been unable to walk	on her	left leg	since the accident and is complaining that her ankle is sore. She is otherwise fit and well with no significant PMH.	 She is on no regular medication, has no known drug allergies. On examination she has a swollen and tender medial malleolus with	a markedly reduced ROM. She screams when you touch the medial aspect of her ankle. The foot is neurovascularly intact. No wounds are evident. X-rays which were taken are shown below. What does this X-ray show?

A: Salter- harris type I
B: Salter- harris type II
C: Salter- harris type III
D: Salter- harris type IV
E: Salter- harris type V

Ans: B




9. A 16-year-old male patient presented to the ED following a varus injury to his right knee which was sustained during a football game. It was noted that he was unable to bear weight. There was a gross effusion of the knee which he held at 5� of flexion and examination showed tenderness over the lateral aspect of the distal femur. He also complained that he was having difficulties dorsiflexing his foot. What other features could he present with?
A: Difficulties inverting his foot
B: Tingling sensation on the dorsum of his foot
C: Numbness at the posteromedial side of the lower leg
D: Inability to plantarflex his big toe
E: There is posterior sag of the knee

Correct answer: B
The case vignette seems to suggest that the patient could be suffering from a LCL tear which is complicated by common peroneal nerve palsy. This is because there is a varus injury and common peroneal nerve palsy is usually associated with foot drop, inability in dorsiflexion and eversion, sensory disturbance of anterolateral side of the lower leg and dorsum of foot. 

10. A 20 year old patient presents to the ED unconscious following a car accident. What would be your next appropriate management?

A: AP view X- ray 
B: Odontoid view x-ray 
C: Apply C-spine collar
D: Intubation
E: Try moving the neck to test ROM of neck

Ans: C
Always suspect C-spine injuries in patients who present after fall from height, diving accident or vehicle accident in which neck is forcibly moved. Furthermore, look out for the following signs and symptoms of cervical spine fracture / spinal cord injury (Unconscious from head injury, abnormal position of neck, tenderness on palpation or pain/ parasthesia in limbs). Secure C-spine before ABCs to prevent any unwanted trauma. In such high risk patients, only remove C-collar after confirming through imaging.
