### 4. Explanation Quality (Important)
- [ ] Explains WHY the correct answer is right
- [ ] Includes relevant clinical pearls or teaching points
- [ ] Evidence-based reasoning provided
- [ ] At least 30 characters in length
- [ ] Clear and educationally valuable

### 5. Difficulty Level (Important)

- [ ] High-yield exam content

### 6. Question Quality (Important)
- [ ] Clear and unambiguous wording
- [ ] Free of grammatical errors
- [ ] No cueing or pattern-based hints
- [ ] Culturally appropriate and unbiased
- [ ] Clinically relevant

### 7. No Duplicates (Critical)

- [ ] Covers different clinical scenario or concept
- [ ] Not just rewording of previous question

### 8. CSV Formatting (Critical)
- [ ] Proper CSV syntax
- [ ] Fields with commas are quoted
- [ ] No unescaped quotes
- [ ] Sequential ID numbering

## Output Format

Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:

## Scoring Rubric

**Per Question (0-10 points):**
- Medical Accuracy: 0-4 points (critical)
- Question Structure: 0-2 points (critical)
- Correct Answer: 0-2 points (critical)
- Explanation Quality: 0-1 point
- Difficulty Level: 0-1 point

**Overall Score:**
- Average of all question scores
- Must be ≥ 9.0 to pass automatic review
- Questions with score < 7.0 are flagged for manual review

## Pass/Fail Criteria

**PASS (Auto-merge):**
- Overall score ≥ 9.0/10
- All questions medically accurate
- No critical issues
- All questions have 5 options
- All CSV formatting correct

**FAIL (Require manual review):**
- Overall score < 9.0/10
- Any medically inaccurate content
- Any critical structural issues
- Missing options or incorrect formatting
- Ambiguous correct answers

## Special Considerations

### Red Flags (Automatic Fail):
- Outdated medical practices (e.g., deprecated treatments)
- Factually incorrect anatomical/physiological statements
- Multiple defensible correct answers
- Dangerous or harmful medical advice
- Missing options (less than 5 per question)

### Common Issues to Watch For:
- Confusion between ACL and PCL tests
- Incorrect classification systems (Garden, Weber, etc.)
- Wrong nerve distributions
- Outdated fracture management
- Mixing up clinical signs and tests

## Examples of Good vs. Bad Questions

### Good Question Example:
```csv
51,"A 23-year-old rugby player presents with acute knee pain after a tackle. He heard a 'pop' and has immediate swelling. Lachman test shows increased anterior translation with soft endpoint. Which additional injury is MOST commonly associated?","PCL tear","LCL tear","Medial meniscus tear","Patellar dislocation","Quadriceps rupture",C,"ACL tears commonly occur with medial meniscus tears (unhappy triad: ACL, MCL, medial meniscus). Lateral meniscus tears are less common. PCL tears occur with dashboard injuries. Patellar dislocation presents differently."
```

**Why it's good:**
- Clear clinical vignette
- One unambiguous answer (C)
- Plausible distractors
- Comprehensive explanation
- Tests clinical reasoning

### Bad Question Example:
```csv
52,"What is the treatment for ACL tears?","Surgery","Conservative","Physiotherapy","Rest",,"A","Treatment depends on multiple factors."
```

**Why it's bad:**
- Only 4 options (missing Option E)
- Multiple defensible answers (surgery vs conservative both valid)
- Incomplete explanation
- Too vague
- No clinical context

## Your Response

Review all questions thoroughly and provide the JSON evaluation. Be strict but fair. Patient safety and educational quality depend on your review.

Remember:
- Medical accuracy is paramount
- When in doubt, flag for manual review
- Err on the side of caution for auto-merge decisions
- Provide constructive feedback for improvements
