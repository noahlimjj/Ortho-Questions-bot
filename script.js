        options: ["Biceps tendon rupture", "Supraspinatus tear", "Subscapularis tear", "Infraspinatus tear"],
        answer: "Supraspinatus tear",
        explanation: "The drop arm test specifically evaluates supraspinatus function. A positive test (inability to slowly lower the arm from 90Â° abduction) suggests a significant supraspinatus tear.",
