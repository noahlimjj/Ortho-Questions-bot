        question: "A 47 year old woman, who had just finished her surgical fixation for a complex distal radial fracture of the right arm 12 hours ago, complains of severe forearm pain in the PACU. The anesthetist suspects that the increasing pain is caused by an incomplete nerve block and hence she performs another nerve block with ropivacaine. However, the patient was still screaming due to severe pain and hence the anesthetist came to you. Being Dr. Ooguway, the Master of Medicine, what would be the least appropriate next step in this case?",
        options: ["Check if there is any tingling or pin prick sensation over the area", "Check for pale skin tone over the area", "Use a needle manometer", "Passively extend the muscles and see whether there is increase in pain"],
        answer: "Use a needle manometer",
        explanation: "This is commonly used for unconscious/obtunded patients in clinical practice because you canât elicit pain history from them. However, if the patient complains of excruciating pain and if in the right clinical context, emergency management for compartment syndrome can be performed. Check for 5 âPâs if suspect compartment syndrome â Pain, Paresthesia, pressure, pallor, pulselessness.",
