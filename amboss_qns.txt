"67-year-old man develops sudden severe right arm pain and paresthesia with brachial artery occlusion, thrombocytopenia (60,000/mm³), and prolonged aPTT six days after femur fracture fixation surgery. What is the most likely explanation?","Peripheral arterial disease","Patent foramen ovale","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","Adverse effect of medication","Fat embolization","D","Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is an immune-mediated adverse effect of heparin occurring 5–14 days after initiation, characterized by thrombocytopenia and paradoxical thrombotic events such as arterial occlusion despite elevated aPTT."
"68-year-old woman with sudden L4 vertebral fracture, chronic knee pain, hearing loss, elevated ALP, normal calcium and GGT over 2 weeks","Type 1 osteopetrosis","Osteoporosis","Primary biliary cholangitis","Osteomalacia","Paget disease of bone","E","Paget disease of bone involves disorganized bone remodeling by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, leading to elevated ALP with normal calcium and phosphate, bone pain, pathological fractures, and sensorineural hearing loss from ossicle involvement."
"An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman with hypertension and a history of gastroesophageal reflux–related esophageal stricture is found on routine screening to have a T-score of –2.6 SD. She experienced menarche at age 11, menopause 8 years ago, and was treated for endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago; her last mammogram and Pap smear 6 months ago were normal. She has no children, a maternal history of breast cancer, and currently takes lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. The physician recommends raloxifene for osteoporosis prophylaxis and asks about its specific adverse effects.","Mandibular osteonecrosis","Endometrial cancer","Osteosarcoma","Hypercholesterolemia","Deep venous thrombosis","E","Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as an estrogen agonist in bone and antagonist in breast and endometrium, reducing bone resorption without increasing endometrial cancer risk. However, it mimics estrogen’s prothrombotic effects, significantly increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism such as deep venous thrombosis. It does not cause mandibular osteonecrosis or osteosarcoma, and it does not adversely affect lipid profiles to cause hypercholesterolemia. Patient counseling should emphasize VTE risk when starting raloxifene."
