### Future: GitHub Issues API
To upgrade to automatic GitHub Issues creation:

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token
2. Add this code to `script.js`:

```javascript
async function submitToGitHub(feedback) {
    const GITHUB_TOKEN = 'your_token_here';
    const REPO_OWNER = 'your_username';
    const REPO_NAME = 'your_repo';

    const issueTitle = `[Question ${feedback.questionID}] ${feedback.issueType}`;
    const issueBody = `
**Question ID:** ${feedback.questionID}
**Issue Type:** ${feedback.issueType}
**Timestamp:** ${feedback.timestamp}

**Question:**
${feedback.question}

**User's Answer:** ${feedback.userAnswer}
**Correct Answer:** ${feedback.correctAnswer}

**Details:**
${feedback.details}
    `;

    const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/issues`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}`,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            title: issueTitle,
            body: issueBody,
            labels: ['question-feedback', 'user-report']
        })
    });

    return response.ok;
}
```
